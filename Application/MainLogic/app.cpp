//this is main application logic,
//keep API calls and imperative in other modules,
//here is ONLY declarative code that tells to the modules what it wants.
//so if you find yourself here creating big loops or data science,
//youre defenetly doing it wrong,
//because you should do that in DataProcessing module
//same goes for Output modules,
//because these should work independently from main application
